# ANALYZING SPOTIFY DATA

Welcome to my music analytics project. Here, I look closely at my Spotify music listening habits. I love both music and data, and this project brings them together to find out what my music choices say about me. By analyzing my data, I want to learn about my regular song choices and see how they change. This project is like mapping my musical journey to understand not just the songs I play the most, but also why I choose them and what patterns show up over time.



----------
Overview
----------
This project delves into my Spotify streaming history to extract insights about my listening preferences. The analysis spans across various dimensions, such as the platforms I frequently use for Spotify searches, the songs and albums I listen to the most in my playlists, and the total hours I've spent listening to my top tracks throughout 2023.

Motivation

I started this project because I was curious about my music listening habits. I wanted to find out if I keep listening to the same songs and what that says about my music choices. This project was also a good chance for me to get better at analyzing and showing data, using the real music streaming history from my own experience. It's a mix of my interest in music and improving my skills in working with data.
